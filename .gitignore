# Backend specific cache/temp
backend/node_modules/.prisma/client/ # Prisma client is generated, often good to ignore and generate on build/postinstall
# However, for Vercel serverless, sometimes it's easier to commit it if generation is tricky in build step.
# Let's start by NOT ignoring .prisma/client and see if Vercel handles generation. If not, we commit it.
